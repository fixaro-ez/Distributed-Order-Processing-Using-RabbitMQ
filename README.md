# Distributed-Order-Processing-Using-RabbitMQ
A microservices-based backend that handles high-volume order processing for a simulated food delivery platform. By using RabbitMQ, the system decouples the order placement from secondary tasks like email notifications and kitchen ticket printing, ensuring the API remains fast even under heavy load.
